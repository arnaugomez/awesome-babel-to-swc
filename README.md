### Roadmap 🏎️

Our main goal is to create a comprehensive collection of Babel plugins and their SWC equivalent.
We also provide tools and information that can help developers migrate from Babel to SWC.

### How to contribute 🏗️

¿Do you have a Babel/SWC plugin that is not in the list? ¿Do you want to share a resource? ¿Have you found a typo? You can submit a pull request and we will review it in under 24hrs.

If you have a Babel plugin but haven't found its SWC equivalent, you are encouraged to:

- Add a row to the list and leave the SWC plugin blank.
- Create a new issue to ask for help to the community.

We are aso looking for maintainers that want to review pull requests.
